# AI-technician

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A predictive maintenance Algorithm that will help determine when a machine will break down before it does to allow for proper action before the fact and thus prevent chaos.

## Background

Small hospitals that have little budget to oversize their fixed assets and follow up quickly with maintenance could:
* Keep machines working at all times
* Spend money more efficiently on long lasting equipment
* etc.

## How is it used?

Connecting with existing APIs we will be able to follow up on GE equipment real time variables which when compared to historical data will allow for immediate follow up and anticipated mantainance to keep machines running. 

## Data sources and AI methods

GE IoT Data
Siemens Healthineers Data
Kaggle Repositories

## Challenges

We will focus first only on machines that are already reporting to the internet, retrofiting old machines to also report would be a second phase which will require greater hardware expertise to do so.

## What next?

Devs (ML, Backend, Frontend) are welcomed, as well as business professionals (knowledgeable in business dev, marketing, management), the only requirement is a strong and continuos interest for building things for good which will be applied to solve our world problems, even if there is little profit to be made, as long as there is value to be generated, such problem should be addressed. 

## Acknowledgments

* Augury is a company that has set an example for us to follow, we aim to do something like their product, but for healthcare related equipment.
* Cooperation from GE, Siemens, and others will be needed for this project to work optimally.
